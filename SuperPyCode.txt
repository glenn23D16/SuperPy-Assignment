The initialize_data_files() function is called before executing any command, which ensures that
the required data files exist before reading or writing to them.
Each command's arguments are parsed appropriately, and the correct function is executed based on
the command name.
When executing the buy command, the data is read from the bought_data.csv file, a new row is
created with the relevant information, and then the updated data is written back to the file.
When executing the sell command, the read_bought() function is used to read the data from the
bought_data.csv file, and the matching product is found by iterating through the rows. If a matching
product is found, a new row is created with the relevant information, and the updated data is written
back to the sold_data.csv file. Otherwise, an error message is printed.
When executing the list command, the data is read from the bought_data.csv and sold_data.csv files,
and then filtered based on the specified start and end dates, if any. Two PrettyTable objects are
then created to display the filtered data.
When executing the revenue command, the data is read from the sold_data.csv file, and then filtered 
based on the specified start and end dates, if any. The filtered data is then used to calculate the
revenue, and a PrettyTable object is created to display the revenue.
When executing the plot command, the plot_revenue() function is called with the specified start and
end dates, if any.
When executing the advance_time command, the get_current_date() function is used to read the current
date from the current_date.txt file, the new date is calculated by adding the specified number of days,
and then the set_current_date() function is used to write the new date back to the file.
